## Introduction

In this course, we dived deep into the world of Computer Vision, exploring and implementing a range of tracking and detection algorithms. The highlight of our learning journey was a comprehensive project that involved researching models and algorithms related to Computer Vision tracking and detection. Our goal was to understand and implement the methods discussed in scientific research papers, focusing on the "Track Long and Prosper" (TLP) dataset—a long-term visual object tracking benchmark.

The TLP dataset is notable for its extensive collection of 50 HD videos from real-world scenarios, totaling over 400 minutes (676K frames). It is distinguished by its length, both in terms of average duration per sequence and overall content, providing a comprehensive platform for evaluating advanced tracking solutions.

## TLP Dataset and Computer Vision Algorithms Demonstration

To offer a glimpse into the TLP dataset and the various computer vision algorithms, we recommend viewing the following video. It is a demonstration provided by the creators of the TLP dataset, showcasing different neural network models tracking moving objects under various challenging conditions, such as occlusion, fast motion, scale variation, and more.

*Note: The video above is a demonstration by the TLP dataset creators and is included here for illustrative purposes to complement our project's context.*

## Project Content

The core of our project is encapsulated in a detailed PDF document (in Catalan), which outlines our exploration and implementation efforts. It includes an overview of the algorithms and techniques we employed, such as the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), alongside our ventures into neural network models influenced by academic literature.

Within this repository, you will find the PDF that thoroughly describes our methodology, challenges, implementations, and the outcomes of our experiments on the TLP dataset.
